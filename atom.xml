    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Golang Rules!!!!! I recently have started researching this language to create a rest API that I can use with applications I will be creating. Before jumping into directly creating the rest API, I wanted to make sure I learn all the details on how the net/http package works. I will be building this application slowly so it will be spanning multiple post.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>I created a simple http server that prints a message when its running. For example, if the http server is listening on localhost:8080 and you visit it with the following url - localhost:8080/linef then it will serve a page with the following text: ‘Hi there, I love linef!’.</p>
<p>The code to the application is as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">alert(&apos;Hello World!&apos;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today I will be writing an application a day and highlighting it here on my blog. Since this is a new endeavor for me the applications will most likely be simple. Nothing too complex, just small applications that either solve a problem or I found that would be interesting writing. The application language will vary as I will be exploring different languages on my path to become a more proficient polyglot developer. Here and there I will be throwing a little bit of personal blog post about my life to keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the daily reads!</p>
