    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, I will start writing an application a day and highlight it here on my blog. Since this is a new endeavor for me the applications will most likely be simple. Nothing too complex, just small applications that either solve a problem or I found that it would be interesting writing. Now the great thing is that since this is a blog I will also write about things I find interesting in my personal daily life.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy daily reads!</p>
